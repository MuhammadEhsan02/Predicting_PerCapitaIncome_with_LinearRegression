# Predicting Per Capita Income Trends with Linear Regression

## Overview
This repository contains code and datasets for predicting per capita income trends using linear regression analysis. The primary objective of this project is to analyze historical per capita income data for Canada and build a robust linear regression model capable of predicting future trends. The dataset comprises information about per capita income (in US dollars) for various years. The project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, evaluation, and prediction using linear regression techniques. Through this project, we aim to gain insights into linear regression concepts and their practical application in predicting economic indicators.

`git clone` https://github.com/MuhammadEhsan02/Predicting_PerCapitaIncome_with_LinearRegression.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd Predicting_PerCapitaIncome_with_LinearRegression`

3. Install the required dependencies by running:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Explore the `notebook/` directory to understand the workflow and execute the Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of historical per capita income data for Canada. It includes information about per capita income (in US dollars) for various years. The dataset is provided in CSV format and is located in the `data/` directory.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using various metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) values. These metrics are computed to assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in predicting per capita income trends.

## Results and Findings
Detailed insights, visualizations, and analysis results are documented in the Jupyter notebooks available in the `notebook/` directory. The findings provide valuable insights into the trends and patterns observed in per capita income data over time, as well as the predictive capabilities of the linear regression model.

## Future Work
- Experiment with different regression algorithms and techniques to enhance predictive performance.
- Incorporate additional features and datasets to improve model accuracy and robustness.
- Explore advanced modeling approaches, such as ensemble methods and deep learning, for predicting economic indicators.
